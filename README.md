# Implementation of Basic Algorithms in Python
These are basic implementations of some important algorithms mentioned in the book *[Algorithms Unlocked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_Unlocked)* by Thomas Cormen. 

This is a work in progress and would be expanded on as I progress through the book. In addition, I might enhance the functions to contemplate other scenarios and/or other algorithms that I find elsewhere.
